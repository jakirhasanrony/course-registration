# Three Features of this project "Course Registration"
+ **Course Selection:** Here, whenever users access the application, they will see a list of available courses. There are total 9 available courses, each course is represented as a card with relevant information : course title, course details, price, credit ours etc. After seeing all these, users can select the ones they are interested in by clicking the "Select" button.
+ **Credit Hour Tracking and Price Calculation:** In this application, this feature dynamically calculates and displays the total credit hour and total cost of the selected courses. This works in tandem to provide users with essential information about their selected courses to ensure that they are staying within predefined limits. Here's the limitation: users can't be able to add more than 20 credit hours. 
+ **Error Handling and Toast Notification:** This application is designed to handle error s smoothly, making it easy for users. When users will try to add a course twice or picking too many courses, the application quickly tells users about it. It does this by showing little pop-up message (toast) that explain the problem.
